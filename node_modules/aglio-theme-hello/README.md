# Aglio Sample Theme Engine
This is a very simple example theme engine for [Aglio](https://github.com/danielgtaylor/aglio#readme). You may fork it and use it as a starting point for developing your own themes.

See the [Aglio theme documentation](https://github.com/danielgtaylor/aglio#writing-a-theme-engine) for more information.
